## Surah Detection from Voice
This project is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload or record audio of Quran recitation and automatically identify the Surah and Ayah being recited. Once identified, the app displays the matched verse, its English translation, and tafsir (exegesis). It is designed to help Muslims better understand and interact with the Quran using modern speech recognition tools.

## Overview
The application uses OpenAI’s Whisper model to transcribe Arabic recitations into text. It then compares the transcribed text against a local database of Quran verses to find the closest match. Once a verse is matched, the corresponding translation and tafsir are displayed.

This tool can be helpful for learners of Quranic recitation, students of tafsir, or anyone looking to explore the Quran using voice-based interaction.

## Features

1. **Upload a `.wav` file** of a Quran verse and identify it.
2. **Record your voice live** through the microphone.
3. **Automatic transcription** using Whisper.
4. **Fuzzy matching** to detect the closest Quran verse.
5. **Display the matched verse** in Arabic.
6. **Show English translation** and **Arabic tafsir**.
7. **Use local JSON files** for fast lookup and offline access.
